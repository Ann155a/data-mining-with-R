# ðŸ”§ Data Mining Techniques in R
This repository contains a collection of R code snippets and utilities for common data mining and statistical tasks. 
Topics include:
- Exploratory data analysis **(EDA)**
- Statistical hypothesis testing
- Data visualization and charting with `ggplot2` and base R
- Web scraping using `rvest` and related packages
I would like to provide this modular, for reusable code for students, researchers, and data enthusiasts working with R.

_(This repository will be updated periodically.)_
